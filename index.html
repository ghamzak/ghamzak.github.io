          As an AI Client Engineer at IBM watsonx, I specialize in Foundation Models and AI systems. My mission is to harness the power of the watsonx platform to co-create value through AI for businesses. My work involves collaborating with clients to develop and deploy AI systems that tackle real-world business challenges across diverse industries worldwide. <br>


          Prior to my current role, I had the privilege of serving as an NLP Research Scientist at RedShred. In this capacity, I had the opportunity to work on projects at the intersection of AI and real-world business challenges, with a particular focus on neural information retrieval, fine-tuning, harnessing, and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs). My expertise extended to performing Named Entity Recognition (NER), information extraction, and entity linking, utilizing a mastery of both machine/deep learning and generative AI techniques. <br>


          In my current position, I continue to build upon this foundation of experience, guiding AI solutions through every stage of the lifecycle, from Data Engineering and Training to Validation, Tuning, Deployment, AI Operations, and AI Governance. My goal is to build end-to-end AI solutions that are not only effective but also trusted. <br>

          Beyond my professional endeavors, I am passionate about contributing to the AI community. In addition to actively serving as a reviewer for years, in 2023, I served as an area chair in the *SEM2023 workshop, co-located with ACL2023 in Toronto, Canada. Looking ahead to 2024, I am excited to take on the role of Reproducibility Chair at the NAACL2024 conference. <br>

          I hold a PhD in Computational Linguistics, with a research focus on neuro-symbolic AI and natural language understanding, earned from the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by the illustrious <a target="_blank" href="https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/palmer-martha/">Professor Martha Palmer</a>. Working under her mentorship, I was privileged to embrace an interdisciplinary perspective that allowed me to constantly learn, evolve, and push the boundaries of my passion. My academic background complements my practical experience, enabling me to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world AI applications. <br><br>
